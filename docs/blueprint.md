# **App Name**: CollaBoard

## Core Features:

- Sidebar Navigation: Collapsible sidebar navigation with a clean, modern design. It should include Dashboard, Videocall Template, Client Details, Order Request, Deposit, Withdrawal, Team Performance, Agent Performance, Reporting, Daily Added, Announcement, Inventory, and Settings. Icon visibility is maintained during collapse.
- Content Area: Main content area that is initially blank and ready for integration.
- Sidebar Toggle: Intuitive hamburger icon for toggling the sidebar, accompanied by a smooth animation.
- Responsive Design: Responsive design that ensures the dashboard works seamlessly on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White blue (#E6F7FF) for a calming, clean feel, reflecting the requested accent.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for light mode and dark gray (#333333) for dark mode to ensure readability and contrast.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of blue (#ADD8E6) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, is used to create a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, which matches the professional, minimal style desired by the user.
- Minimalist design with a focus on clear spacing and alignment. The sidebar uses a vertical layout, and the main content area is designed to be flexible.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a consistent set, ensuring they remain visible even in the collapsed state of the sidebar.
- Smooth transition animations for sidebar expansion and collapse, and subtle animations for interactive elements like hover effects on buttons.
